Iâ€™ve been looking for a way to spend my free time and with Poker as a hobby I thought it be perfect. The only problem is that its difficult to find enough players to get together for a fun session. With Poker 414 ti takes care of that problem for me! I just show up and there are other eager players waiting to play!

Poker is always fun but sometimes the pace is terrible because you have to pass the deal around. Some of the players are very bad at shuffling and it slows the pace down. Which is a disadvantage with the rising blind levels. At Poker 414 though they have a designated dealer and the cards go flying!

I enjoy poker but always had trouble making any friends who enjoy the same passion as I do. Here at Poker 414 I was able to make friends so easily. The crowd there is very nice and the tournament directors are very agile on the safety of their players. From resolving arguments and banning unruly people to keep a pleasant environment!
