          <p>
            It’s always completely free to play Poker League 414 free roll poker tournaments. We are a great team and can only make these tournaments happen with lots of help from all of you. (Thank you!)We have over 4 year’s experience playing and running freeroll poker games. Ryan has over 5 year’s experience playing and running freeroll poker games. We previously traveled to Las Vegas to complete Texas Holdem training so that we could continue to learn and keep our games updated on current rules, etc. You are always welcome to come talk to us about questions you have, concerns, or ideas on how we can improve. We welcome your feedback. Thank you for your support of our league!
